        <div class="text1">
            <h1>Bed</h1>
            <p>The bed represents intimacy, vulnerability, and the complex emotions that accompany sexual relationships. For David, the bed is a space where he can explore his desires and emotional attachments, but it also becomes a site of discomfort. His interactions with Giovanni on the bed reveal his internal struggle—he is torn between attraction and fear, passion and guilt. The bed becomes a symbol of the boundaries David is unwilling to cross fully, as well as the emotional and physical barriers he places between himself and Giovanni.</p>

            <div class="text2">
                <h1>Door</h1>
                <p>The door in Giovanni’s room acts as a threshold, both literally and figuratively, symbolizing David’s need to escape. It is the point of entry and exit, where moments of connection or separation occur. For much of the novel, the door represents the distance David tries to maintain from his emotions and from Giovanni. Every time David contemplates leaving or entering, he faces a choice: to confront his feelings or retreat. The door thus symbolizes David’s fear of commitment, his struggle to stay within the boundaries of his own repressed desires, and his desire to avoid the deeper connection that Giovanni offers.</p>

        <img src="imgs/window.png" alt="Window" class="window">
        <div class="text3">
            <h1>Window</h1>
            <p>The window is a recurring symbol of separation and observation in the novel. It provides a glimpse into the world beyond the confines of Giovanni’s room, highlighting the contrast between the world outside and the emotional imprisonment David feels inside. The window also represents David's longing for freedom and escape, but it also traps him in his own reflections. At times, the window seems like a barrier—preventing true engagement with the world outside, just as David’s own internal barriers prevent him from fully accepting his sexuality and the love Giovanni offers.</p>

        <img src="imgs/alcohol.png" alt="Alcohol" class="alcohol">
        <div class="text4">
            <h1>Alcohol</h1>
            <p>Alcohol and substances symbolize escapism, self-destruction, and emotional repression. David drinks to suppress his desires and momentarily escape his guilt, while Giovanni turns to alcohol as his life unravels. The bars filled with drunken men highlight the loneliness and fleeting nature of their connections. Substance use reflects the characters’ attempts to avoid reality, yet it only deepens their despair. In the end, alcohol serves as both a mask and a mirror, concealing their truths while exposing their vulnerabilities.</p>

        <img src="imgs/clutter.png" alt="Clutter" class="clutter">
        <div class="text5">
            <h1>Clutter</h1>
            <p>The clutter in Giovanni’s room symbolizes chaos, entrapment, and the weight of the past. Scattered clothes, empty bottles, and forgotten objects reflect Giovanni’s declining state and his inability to escape his circumstances. For David, the mess is both suffocating and revealing, mirroring his own internal conflict and lack of control. The room’s disorder contrasts with the structured life David tries to maintain outside, highlighting the tension between freedom and societal expectations. Ultimately, the clutter serves as a physical manifestation of the emotional turmoil and decay that define their relationship.</p>

    <div class="parent6">
        <img src="imgs/mirror.png" alt="Mirror" class="mirror">
        <div class="text6">
            <h1>Mirror</h1>
            <p>The mirror symbolizes self-examination, denial, and the conflict between appearance and truth. When David looks into it, he is forced to confront his desires and guilt, yet he often recoils, unable to fully accept himself. Giovanni’s remark that David "loves his purity, loves his mirror" highlights David’s obsession with maintaining a false, controlled image. The dust and imperfections on the mirror suggest the distortion between who David pretends to be and who he truly is. Ultimately, the mirror reflects not just his face but his deepest fears and insecurities.</p>
