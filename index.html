            <h1>Bed</h1>
            <p>The bed represents intimacy, vulnerability, and the complex emotions that accompany sexual relationships. For David, the bed is a space where he can explore his desires and emotional attachments, but it also becomes a site of discomfort. His interactions with Giovanni on the bed reveal his internal struggle—he is torn between attraction and fear, passion and guilt. The bed becomes a symbol of the boundaries David is unwilling to cross fully, as well as the emotional and physical barriers he places between himself and Giovanni.</p>

                <h1>Door</h1>
                <p>The door in Giovanni’s room acts as a threshold, both literally and figuratively, symbolizing David’s need to escape. It is the point of entry and exit, where moments of connection or separation occur. For much of the novel, the door represents the distance David tries to maintain from his emotions and from Giovanni. Every time David contemplates leaving or entering, he faces a choice: to confront his feelings or retreat. The door thus symbolizes David’s fear of commitment, his struggle to stay within the boundaries of his own repressed desires, and his desire to avoid the deeper connection that Giovanni offers.</p>
