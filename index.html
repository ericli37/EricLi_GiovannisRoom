            <h1>Bed</h1>
            <p>The bed in Giovanni’s Room represents intimacy and the vulnerability that accompany sexual relationships. For David, the bed is a space where he can explore his emotional yearning, but it also becomes a site of discomfort. His interactions with Giovanni on the bed reveal his internal struggle—he is torn between attraction and fear. The bed is a place where David thinks he can make love purely for enjoyment, but in reality, it has him trapped in an emotional cage.</p>

                <h1>Door</h1>
                <p>The door in Giovanni’s Room acts as a barrier that David wants to overcome. It is the entry and exit, where moments of connection or separation occur. For much of the novel, the door represents the consequences of David’s indecisiveness. Every time David contemplates leaving or entering, he faces a choice: to confront his feelings or run. The door thus shows David’s fear of commitment and his own expectations imposed on himself to be a “normal” man despite the deeper connection that Giovanni offers.</p>

        <div class="text3">
            <h1>Window</h1>
            <p>The window is a recurring symbol of separation and observation in the novel. It provides a glimpse into the world beyond the confines of Giovanni’s room, highlighting the contrast between the world outside and the emotional imprisonment David feels inside. The window also represents David's longing for freedom and escape, but it also traps him in his own reflections. At times, the window seems like a barrier—preventing true engagement with the world outside, just as David’s own internal barriers prevent him from fully accepting his sexuality and the love Giovanni offers.</p>

        <div class="text4">
            <h1>Alcohol</h1>
            <p>Alcohol as well as cigarettes and drugs in Giovanni’s Room offer a temporary escape, but ultimately lead to self-destruction, as seen when Giovanni turns to opioids as his life unravels. Additionally, David drinks and smokes to suppress his lust and momentarily escape his true feelings. For example, when Jaques is advising him to embrace his homosexuality, David pretends to “not know what [he’s] talking about”, and “feels that [he’d] better get drunk” (41). This leads down a sad road, however, as the bars filled with drunken men highlight the loneliness of evading one’s true nature. In the end, substance use demonstrates the characters’ attempts to avoid reality, yet it only deepens their despair.</p>

        <img src="imgs/clutter.png" alt="Clutter" class="clutter">
        <div class="text5">
            <h1>Clutter</h1>
            <p>The clutter in Giovanni’s Room symbolizes chaos and the weight of the past. “Boxes of cardboard and leather towering like a wall” and a violin “lying on the table in its warped, cracked case” (87) reflect Giovanni’s declining state. When David sees the disorder, he immediately understands it to be both suffocating and revealing, displaying Giovanni’s inability to escape his circumstances and echoing his own internal conflict and lack of control. The room’s disorder contrasts with the structured appearance David tries to maintain outside, which is why Giovanni coveted him: David “was to destroy this room and give to Giovanni a new and better life” (88).</p>

        <img src="imgs/mirror.png" alt="Mirror" class="mirror">
        <div class="text6">
            <h1>Mirror</h1>
            <p>The mirror in Giovanni’s Room forces self-examination and causes denial. When David looks into it to confront his desires and guilt, he recoils, unable to fully accept himself. Giovanni’s remark that David "loves [his] purity, loves [his] mirror" (141) highlights David’s obsession with maintaining a false image. He recognizes his disgust towards himself when he sees his “nakedness which he must hold sacred, though it be never so vile” (169), yet he continues to reject his true identity. Ultimately, the mirror reflects not just his face but his deepest insecurities.</p>
